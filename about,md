Hi, I am Wayne Marks and have been in IT since 2002 upon leaving the Military. Since then I have worked on government-sensitive projects and with various Microsoft partners. I joined Microsoft in 2020 and am currently employed as an Infrastructure Cloud Solutions Architect in a global team, specialising in networking, data centre migrations and BCDR. I have supported enterprise and government customers in Australia, EMEA, multiple countries in Africa, as well as the UK.

Outside of work, I am married with four daughters, two granddaughters, and a grandson on the way. I also have an unhealthy obsession with Springer Spaniel dogs. I currently have two and a third is on the way.
