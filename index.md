I’m **Wayne Marks**, a UK-based Microsoft Infrastructure Cloud Solution Architect (CSA), and this space is where I share practical insights, architectures, and real-world lessons from working with customers across Azure.

> 🔷 *This GitHub blogging project is new to me* — it’s a learn-and-grow-together exercise. My goal is to capture and share useful, hands-on guidance. I’ll keep the content focused, practical, and transparent about what works (and what doesn’t) in the field.
