Iâ€™m **Wayne Marks**, a UK-based Microsoft Infrastructure Cloud Solution Architect (CSA), and this space is where I share practical insights, architectures, and real-world lessons from working with customers across Azure.

> ðŸ”· *This GitHub blogging project is new to me* â€” itâ€™s a learn-and-grow-together exercise.  
> My goal is to capture and share useful, hands-on guidance. Iâ€™ll keep the content focused, practical, and transparent about what works (and what doesnâ€™t) in the field.
