# 👋 Welcome to Cloud-Recon

I'm Wayne Marks — an Infrastructure Cloud Solution Architect (CSA) with the Microsoft Global team. This space is where I share practical insights, architectures, and real-world lessons from working with customers across Azure.

> 📘 **This GitHub blogging project is new to me** — it’s a learn-and-grow-together exercise. My goal is to capture and share useful, hands-on guidance. I’ll keep the content focused, practical, and transparent about what works (and what doesn’t) in the field.
